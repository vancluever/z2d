# z2d Public Contribution Notice

> [!NOTE]
> **The short of it:** This project does not accept public pull requests. There
> are a few reasons for this, so read on if you want some reasoning, or just
> feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/new)
> with any questions, bugs, or feature requests.

Pull requests to the z2d project are restricted. Any pull request opened will
likely be closed using the [Vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch)
workflow, with a message directing you to this document to explain why.

Note that the project does not accept public pull requests and there are no
plans to change this for the foreseeable future. If you have a feature request
or bug, please open an issue to get further help.

**Please do not use AI to open issues**. If you are using AI or an agent to
understand an issue, take the time to comprehend the output and explain the
issue **in your own words** before submitting.

## Why?

I created z2d as a first-principles approach to understanding graphics
programming. Everything implemented in the library has been either done so from
scratch or imported from other projects in a way that I have been able to learn
and understand from the experience. As the library continues to grow and
improve, it's important to me that this remains this way.

Having the library remain largely authored by myself if the best way to ensure
that this happens. It also ensures that the library continues to follow a
trajectory that I think is best for the purposes it serves, and ensures that I
will not burn out as the maintainer and principal author.

Finally, while the z2d project has luckily not yet been affected by this, the
increasing trend of AI-submitted work has made me loath to keep my projects
open to external contributions in general. Vouch has a [great section
explaining this](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/blob/f0591095f3c46406301604874d2482797fab7bab/README.md#why).
On a personal level, I am not very interested in even having to engage with
content created by AI coding agents and/or other tools (see last section).
**This is not a blanket judgment of the work produced by such tools, or those
that use them.** To each their own.

## Open source, not open contribution

This project is open source and distributed under the terms of the [Mozilla
Public License](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/). Open source, however
does not necessarily mean open contribution, a point that seems to have been in
discourse a lot recently due to the points made in the last paragraph of the
previous section.

Probably the best example of a closed-contribution project is SQLite, which has
some great rationale and statements to this end on their [copyright
page](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html). Echoing the sentiments
particularly in the last part of that page, feature requests and proof of
concepts are welcome, however I will more than likely implement all solutions
to these personally.
