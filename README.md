## About

z2d is a 2D graphics library whose main purpose is to raster shapes composed of
vector primitives: lines and cubic Beziers, e.g., things you would need if you
were rendering something like an SVG file, or rendering shapes directly for UI
elements. It also provides a (growing) API for image manipulation, which mainly
supports our vector rasterization features, but can also be worked with
directly at the lower level.

Our drawing model is (loosely) inspired by
[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org): most operations take place through the
`Context`, which connect `Pattern`s (pixel/color sources) and `Surface`s
(drawing targets/buffers). `Path`s contain the vector data for filling and
stroking operations.

Every component of z2d can be worked with directly in an unmanaged fashion
without the `Context` as well, if so desired; `Surfaces` can be interfaced with
directly, `Surface` and `Path` can be used with static buffers (in addition to
their traditional unmanaged variant), and the `painter` functions for filling
and stroking can be called directly with the output of these. For these cases,
`Context` serves as a reference example. Additionally, plumbing further into
the `painter` package can demonstrate how functions in the `compositor` package
can be worked with at the lower level.

## What's supported

Currently:

 * Basic rendering of lines and cubic Beziers, with helpers for arcs (circles
   native, ellipses through transformations).
 * Filling and stroking:
   - Miter, bevel, and round join supported for stroking.
   - Butt, square, and round caps supported for stroking.
   - Dashed lines supported along with offsets for tweaking alignment of
     patterns to shapes, and zero-length dash stops to draw dotted lines.
 * Transformations: rotate, scale, translate, and other operations via direct
   manipulations of the affine matrix.
 * Composition:
   - Single pixel sources and linear, radial, and conic gradients supported.
     Access to lower-level compositor primitives is supplied to allow for
     manipulation of surfaces outside of higher-level drawing operations.
   - 28 compositor operators supported across the set of Porter-Duff and PDF
     blend modes.
 * Pixel formats:
   - RGBA, RGB, and alpha-only in 8, 4, 2, and 1-bit formats.
 * Color spaces:
   - Linear, sRGB, and HSL currently supported for specifying high-level color.
     Interpolation supported in all color spaces. More color spaces are planed.
 * Exporting:
   - Rudimentary PNG export supported; alpha-channel formats export to
     greyscale.
   - Support for explicitly specifying output RGB profile to assist with proper
     color management.

The current plan is to work towards writing a reasonably feature-complete SVG
renderer, with the ability to utilize the same primitives to perform other
vector rasterization, suitable for UI design and other similar tasks.

## Usage

`zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/vancluever/z2d#[tag or commit]`

Zig 0.14.0 is required; those requiring Zig 0.13.0 should use v0.5.1.

There is currently a `zig-0.15.0` branch that is currently being updated
against the latest Zig 0.15.0.
